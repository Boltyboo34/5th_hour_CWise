#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1
#and then prints "Hello World!" at the end.
import time
for i in range(5,0,-1):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Hello World")

#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers
#between 1 and 30.
#(HINT: Look back to HW6 on how to see if a number is divisible by another)

for b in range(1,31):
    if b % 2 == 0:
        print(b)



#3. Create a for loop that prints 5 different animals from a list.

#4. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")
